# About

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts IMDb scores of movies available on Films based on features like genre, premiere date, runtime, and language. The model will help users discover highly rated films that match their preferences. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.

# Project Design

The project follows a structured design process:

# Data Source

- Utilize a dataset containing information about movies, including features like genre, premiere date, runtime, language, and IMDb scores.

# Data Preprocessing

- Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, and convert categorical features into numerical representations.

# Feature Engineering

- Extract relevant features from the available data that could contribute to predicting IMDb scores.

# Model Selection

- Choose appropriate regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor) for predicting IMDb scores.

# Model Training

- Train the selected model using the preprocessed data.

# Evaluation

- Evaluate the model's performance using regression metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
